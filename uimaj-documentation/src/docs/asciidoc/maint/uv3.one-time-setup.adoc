= Maintainer Setup

== Platform: Java

Most Apache UIMA code is written in Java. To build it, you need a recent Java Development Kit (JDK) which can be obtained from the link:https://adoptium.net[Eclipse Adoptium] project - but there are also plenty of other JDK vendors offering free JDKs (or even ones with commercial support).

The minimum Java version required for building Apache UIMA is: **17**
The minimum Java version required for using Apache UIMA as a library is: **17**

It is recommended to install the latest long term support (LTS) Java version and use it for development. When performing a release, a minimum-version JDK should be used to ensure compatibility for downstream users.

== Version control: Git and Subversion

Apache UIMA projects use Git although some projects still reside in Subversion and releases are staged to the ASF Subversion repository.
Thus, you should install a Subversion client as well as a Git client - best the latest available version.
If you are using an IDE, you may also care to install a suitable Subversion in addition to the Git plugin for the IDE. 
Most IDEs come with Git plugins already pre-installed. 
If you are lucky, it might be enough for you. 
If you need to work with one of the older Subversion repositories of the project, having the Subversion plugin is handy as well.

NOTE: Configure your SVN client to set the `eol-style` to `native`, for newly created files; see https://apache.org/dev/svn-eol-style.txt for instructions on how to do this.

== IDE: Eclipse or another one

Eclipse is usually the IDE of choice for UIMA developers because UIMA provides several Eclipse plugins to facilitate editing UIMA XML descriptor files and the example projects are also currently provided as Eclipse projects.

NOTE: You can also use another IDE like IntelliJ, Netbeans or even VSCode because the builds themselves are largely driven by Maven.

== Build tool: Maven

Most Apache UIMA sub-projects are built using Apache Maven version 3 or higher. 
Maven offers a largely declarative and convention-driven build process and in particular automatically downloads required third-party libraries from the internet, in particular from the link:https://search.maven.org[Maven Central] repository.

You can download the latest Maven version or install it using your favourite package manager. 
Most Java IDEs already come with Maven support pre-installed. 
If your IDE does not offer Maven support out-of-the-box, you may want to install a suitable plugin.

* Download the latest Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org.
* Set up your `PATH` to use this version.
* Set the environment variable `MAVEN_OPTS` to `-Xmx800m  -XX:MaxPermSize=256m`. 
  (Optional, but is needed for some JVM/platforms, to give the JVM enough room to build things.)
