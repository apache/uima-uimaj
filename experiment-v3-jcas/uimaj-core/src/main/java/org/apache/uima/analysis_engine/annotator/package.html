<p>The Annotator Interfaces, along with supporting interfaces
and exception classes.</p>
<p>The annotator interfaces are as follows:
<ul>
<li><code>{@link org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.annotator.BaseAnnotator}</code>: the base interface 
    for all annotators.  Annotators should not implement this directly.</li>
<li><code>{@link org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.annotator.GenericAnnotator}</code>: an annotator that
    can process any type of entity.</li>
<li><code>{@link org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.annotator.TextAnnotator}</code>: an annotator that 
    processes text documents.</li>
<li><code>{@link org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.annotator.JTextAnnotator}</code>: similar to 
    <code>TextAnnotator</code>, but uses the Java-object-based {@link org.apache.uima.jcas.JCas}
    interface instead of the standard {@link org.apache.uima.cas.CAS} interface. </li>
</ul>
</p>
