= Maintainer Setup

== Platform: Java

Most Apache UIMA code is written in Java. To build it, you need a recent Java Development Kit (JDK) which can be obtained from the link:https://adoptium.net[Eclipse Adoptium] project - but there are also plenty of other JDK vendors offering free JDKs (or even ones with commercial support).

The minimum Java version required for Apache UIMA is: **1.8**

It is recommended to install the latest long term support (LTS) Java version and use it for development. When performing a release, a minimum-version JDK should be used to ensure compatibility for downstream users.

== Version control: Git and Subversion

Apache UIMA projects use Subversion as well as Git. Thus, you should install a Subversion client as well as a Git client - best the latest available version.
If you are using an IDE, you should also install a suitable Subversion and Git plugin for the IDE. Most IDEs come with Git plugins already pre-installed. If you are lucky, it might be enough for you. If you need to work with one of the older Subversion repositories of the project, having the Subversion plugin is handy as well.

NOTE: Configure your SVN client to set the eol-style to native, for newly created files; see https://apache.org/dev/svn-eol-style.txt for instructions on how to do this.

== IDE: Eclipse or another one

Eclipse is usually the IDE of choice for UIMA developers because UIMA provides several Eclipse plugins to facilitate editing UIMA XML descriptor files and the example projects are also currently provided as Eclipse projects.

NOTE: You can also use another IDE like IntelliJ, Netbeans or even VSCode because the builds themselves is largely driven by Maven - **but for building the Eclipse update sites as part of the release process, also an Eclipse installation is required.**

== Build tool: Maven

Most Apache UIMA sub-projects are built using Apache Maven version 3 or higher. Maven offers a largely declarative and convention-driven build process and in particular automatically downloads required third-party libraries from the internet, in particular from the link:https://search.maven.org[Maven Central] repository.

You can download the latest Maven version from https://maven.apache.org/download.html or install it using your favourite package manager. Most Java IDEs already come with Maven support pre-installed. If your IDE does not offer Maven support out-of-the-box, you may want to install a suitable plugin.

* Download the latest Apache Maven from .
* Set up your `PATH`` to use this version.
* (Optional, but is needed for some JVM/platforms, to give the JVM enough room to build things). Set the environment variable `MAVEN_OPTS` to `-Xmx800m  -XX:MaxPermSize=256m`

=== Maven toolchains

To ensure that an Apache UIMA build is actually compatible with the minimum system 
requirements, it is important to build it against a minimum requirements environment.
However, it is possible that Maven or plugins we use no longer are able to run on the
same minimum system requirements that Apache UIMA aims to meet and thus for building,
you may need e.g. a never Java version. To ensure that we can still build against
the desired target environment, we use the link:https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/[Maven Toolchains Plugin].

Using this plugin requires that you have a `toolchains.xml` file, typically in your
`~/.m2` folder. This file should contains at least a toolchain declaration for the
Apache UIMA minimum Java version, e.g.:

.Example `toolchains.xml` file
