= Project structure

// REC: The following may not be necessary if we simply add `#readme` to all links to the repo e.g. in the documentation and on the website
// To keep the folder structure lean so it doesn't dominate the view when looking at a repository in GitHub, the project should conform to the following structure. This should allow the contents of the `README.md` file to still be visible without too much scrolling when visiting the project's repository in a web browser.
