<h2><a id="alpha">0. Alpha release status</a></h2>
  <p>This is an alpha release, done in order to expand the 
     community of people doing initial testing on this new release.
     As such, it is possible that bugs or deficiencies may be found
     which might require changes to APIs.</p>
     
  <p>Following a period of alpha testing, depending on the results,
     we will proceed to more official releases.
     </p>
     
<h2><a id="what.is.uima">1. What is UIMA?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Unstructured Information Management applications are
				software systems that analyze large volumes of
				unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
				that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and
				SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM
				application might ingest plain text and identify
				entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
				relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA enables
				such an application to be decomposed into components,
				for example "language identification" -&gt; "language
				specific segmentation" -&gt; "sentence boundary
				detection" -&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
				etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined
				by the framework and must provide self-describing
				metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
				these components and the data flow between them.
				Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
				flows between components is designed for efficient
				mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally
				provides capabilities to wrap components as network
				services, and can scale to very large volumes by
				replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
				networked nodes.
			</p>
      <p>
				Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
				implementation of the UIMA specification (that
				specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
				by a technical committee within
				<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a>,
				a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
				to participate in both the implementation and
				specification efforts.
			</p>
      <p>
				UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured
				content such as text, audio and video. It comprises an
				SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic
				components written in Java and C++, with some support
				for Perl, Python and TCL.
			</p>

<h2><a id="major.changes">Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>

<p>Version 3 is a major reimplementation of the internals of UIMA,
with many significant changes.  A one-time migration step is required if 
JCas cover classes are being used.  
Please read the Version 3 users guide located in the docs directory
for information on these changes and the migration tool.
</p>

<p>A very brief summary of Version 3:
<ul><li>Feature Structures become Java Objects, 
and may be Garbage Collected.</li>
<li>Many performance improvements</li>
<li>Iterating over indexes no longer throws 
ConcurrentModificationException</li>
<li>Support for arbitrary Java Objects in the CAS</li>
<li>Using above, new built-ins for ArrayList style
lists of Feature Structures and ints, and a FSHashSet</li>
<li>New "select" framework for flexible 
access to Feature Structures</li>
<li>Integration with Java 8 facilities such as Streams</li>
<li>Logging framework upgraded</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Please read the overview section of the Version 3 
users guide for more.</p>

<p>Specific changes in this release versus the previous alpha release include
<ul>
  <li>The Eclipse update site for version 3 alpha is now under a new 
    higher level directory, "uimaj-v3-pre-production".  This is to avoid
    users accidentally installing it when they meant to get the lastest 
    production level, which remains under "uimaj".
  </li>
  <li>The "select" framework APIs had javadocs added and some fixes which resulted in API changes for some methods.</li>
  <li>Logging was upgraded in two ways:  The log4j back end for the UIMA logger was upgraded to log4j 2 (the current version).
  And, support was added for the slf4j logging facade.
  The UIMA Logger now implements all the SLF4J Logger APIs, plus the APIs that use Java 8 Suppliers, from
  the Log4j Logger API.</li>
  <li>changes made to uimaj-2.9.0 were merged.</li>
  <li>Various implementations of UIMA built-in types which have corresponding Java 8 non-boxing versions of methods were
    augmented to support non-boxing alternatives; see the API changes report for details.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
 
<h3>API changes</h3>
 <p>This version includes a new API compatibility report covering the non-internal APIs;
   see <a href="api-change-report.html">change report</a> for the list of API changes
   since version 2.10.0-SNAPSHOT.

issues affecting this release.  
   
<h2><a id="alpha">Alpha Release</a></h2>
<p>Because this release makes major changes to UIMA internals,
this is an alpha release of version 3.  It is being made to get 
wider community involvement in testing and feedback.  
The APIs may change, and features
may be added or altered.<\p>
