<h2><a id="what.is.uima">1. What is UIMA?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Unstructured Information Management applications are
				software systems that analyze large volumes of
				unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
				that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and
				SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM
				application might ingest plain text and identify
				entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
				relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA enables
				such an application to be decomposed into components,
				for example "language identification" -&gt; "language
				specific segmentation" -&gt; "sentence boundary
				detection" -&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
				etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined
				by the framework and must provide self-describing
				metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
				these components and the data flow between them.
				Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
				flows between components is designed for efficient
				mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally
				provides capabilities to wrap components as network
				services, and can scale to very large volumes by
				replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
				networked nodes.
			</p>
      <p>
				Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
				implementation of the UIMA specification (that
				specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
				by a technical committee within
				<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a>,
				a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
				to participate in both the implementation and
				specification efforts.
			</p>
      <p>
				UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured
				content such as text, audio and video. It comprises an
				SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic
				components written in Java and C++, with some support
				for Perl, Python and TCL.

<h2><a id="major.changes">Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>

<h3>Iterating over sorted indexes performance improvement</h3>
<p>Sorted index usage by iterators is monitored, and when it is determined that
a particular index is no longer being updated and is experiencing poor performance due to
merging of subindexes for the subtypes being iterated over, a one-time conversion
of this index to a "flattened" version is done; the flattened form incurs the cost
of merging subindexes once, and for subsequent uses, iteration speed is improved.
Any update that affects this flattened index will cause it to be discarded and 
not used for subsequent iterations.  Performance improvement should be seen for the
perhaps common use case where one annotator creates and indexes instances of a type and its subtypes, 
and subsequent annotators read and perhaps update these, 
but don't add or remove entries of this type/subtypes from the index.
Jira issue <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4357">UIMA-4357</a></p>

<h3>Other major changes</h3> 
<ul><li>The Document Analyzer's Java-based Cas Viewer was extended to support being
able to select which annotations are highlighted, using a selection approach where you can
specify a type plus a feature of that type plus one or more values of that feature.
 Jira issue <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-3374">UIMA-3374</a></li>
 
 <li>Performance for iterators over UIMA Set Indexes was improved. 
 Jira issue: <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4345">UIMA-4345</a>.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>API changes</h3>
 <p>Note that we have moved to a more formal semantic versioning, following
 the ideas in <a target="_blank" href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>.</p>
 <p> 
 There were no API changes that affect backward compatibility.  Some new APIs were added or extended.</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Add back the API <code>alreadyCopied</code> that was accidentally removed in the CasCopier class in version 2.7.0.
 Jira issue: <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4428">UIMA-4428</a>.</li>
 
 <li>add new variants of <code>getAllIndexedFS, getIndex, and getAnnotationIndex</code> which take an additional argument
 that specifies the JCas class, and permits these to return the correct generically typed indexes.
