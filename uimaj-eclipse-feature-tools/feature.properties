 \n\
 - Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java (TM) ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".\n\
 \n\
 - A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material.  \n\
   Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named "features".  \n\
   Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins\n\
   and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.\n\
      \n\

The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts") or "LICENSE" ("Licenses"). \n\
The terms and conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained in files named "LICENSE" ("Feature Licenses").  \n\
Abouts, Licenses and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following locations:\n\
\n\
 - The top-level (root) directory\n\
 \n\
 - Plug-in and Fragment directories\n\
\n\
 - Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs\n\

\n\
Note: if a Feature made available by the Apache Software Foundation is installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined below), \n\
you must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the installation process.  \n\
If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions \n\
governing the Included Features or inform you where you can locate them.  \n\
Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature.\n\
Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions \n\
(or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in that directory.\n\

Use of Provisioning Technology\n\
\n\
The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples of which include, but are not limited to, p2 and the Eclipse\n\
   Update Manager ("Provisioning Technology") for the purpose of allowing users to install software, documentation, information and/or\n\
   other materials (collectively "Installable Software"). This capability is provided with the intent of allowing such users to\n\
   install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information about packaging Installable Software is available at \n\
   http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html\n\
   ("Specification").\n\
\n\
You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the\n\
   applicable license agreements relating to the Installable Software to be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology\n\
   in accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it available in accordance with the\n\
   Specification, you further acknowledge your agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following:\n\
\n\
  1. A series of actions may occur ("Provisioning Process") in which a user may execute the Provisioning Technology\n\
     on a machine ("Target Machine") with the intent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an Eclipse-based\n\
     product.\n\
  2. During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be\n\
     accessed and copied to the Target Machine.\n\
  3. Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and conditions that govern the use of the Installable\n\
     Software ("Installable Software Agreement") and such Installable Software Agreement shall be accessed from the Target\n\
     Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and conditions that govern\n\
     the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance by the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable Software Agreement. Upon such\n\
     indication of agreement by the user, the provisioning Technology will complete installation of the Installable Software.\n\
\n\
