/**
 * This annotator will copy the text of one view to another view. It is required that source view
 * already exists. If the destination view does not yet exist, then it will be created. A use case
 * for this analysis engine is when you have a "gold view" which is populated with text and
 * gold-standard annotations. Now you want to run your system/pipeline on a "system view" so that at
 * the end you can compare the annotations in the system view with those in the gold view. It is
 * convenient to have an annotator that simply copies the text from the gold view to the system view
 * before running a pipeline on the system view.
