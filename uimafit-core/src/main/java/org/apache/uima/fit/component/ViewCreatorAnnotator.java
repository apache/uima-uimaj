/**
 * This annotator can be placed at/near the beginning of a pipeline to ensure that a particular view
 * is created before it is used further downstream. It will create a view for the view name
 * specified by the configuration parameter PARAM_VIEW_NAME if it doesn't exist. One place this is
 * useful is if you are using an annotator that uses the default view and you have mapped the
 * default view into a different view via a sofa mapping. The default view is created automatically
 * - but if you have mapped the default view to some other view, then the view provided to your
 * annotator (when it asks for the default view) will not be created unless you have explicitly
 * created it.
