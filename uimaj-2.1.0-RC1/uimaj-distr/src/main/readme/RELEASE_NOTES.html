<h2><a name="what.is.uima">1. What is UIMA?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Unstructured Information Management applications are
				software systems that analyze large volumes of
				unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
				that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and
				SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM
				application might ingest plain text and identify
				entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
				relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA enables
				such an application to be decomposed into components,
				for example "language identification" -&gt; "language
				specific segmentation" -&gt; "sentence boundary
				detection" -&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
				etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined
				by the framework and must provide self-describing
				metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
				these components and the data flow between them.
				Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
				flows between components is designed for efficient
				mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally
				provides capabilities to wrap components as network
				services, and can scale to very large volumes by
				replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
				networked nodes.
			</p>
                                                <p>
				Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
				implementation of the UIMA specification (that
				specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
				by a technical committee within
				<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a>
				, a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
				to participate in both the implementation and
				specification efforts.
			</p>
                                                <p>
				UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured
				content such as text, audio and video. It comprises an
				SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic
				components written in Java and C++, with some support
				for Perl, Python and TCL.
			</p>

<h2><a name="major.changes">2. Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>
<p>
This section describes what has changed between version 2.0 and version 2.1 of 
UIMA. A migration utility is provided which will make the required updates to 
your Java code and descriptors. See Section 3, "Migrating from IBM UIMA to 
Apache UIMA" for instructions on how to run the migration utility.
</p> 
  
<h3>2.1. Java Package Name Changes</h3>
<p>
All of the UIMA Java package names have changed in Apache UIMA. They now start 
with org.apache rather than com.ibm. There have been other changes as well. The 
package name segment reference_impl has been shortened to impl, and some 
segments have been reordered. For example 
com.ibm.uima.reference_impl.analysis_engine has become 
org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl. Tools are now consolidated under 
org.apache.uima.tools and service adapters under org.apache.uima.adapter.
</p>
<p>
The migration utility will replace all occurrences of IBM UIMA package names 
with their Apache UIMA equivalents. It will not replace prefixes of package 
names, so if your code uses a package called com.ibm.uima.myproject (although 
that is not recommended), it will not be replaced.
</p>  
  
<h3>2.2. XML Descriptor Changes</h3>
<p>
The XML namespace in UIMA component descriptors has changed from 
http://uima.watson.ibm.com/resourceSpecifier to 
http://uima.apache.org/resourceSpecifier. The value of the 
&lt;frameworkImplementation> must now be org.apache.uima.java or 
org.apache.uima.cpp. The migration script will apply these replacements.
</p>
  
<h3>2.3. TCAS replaced by CAS</h3>
<p>
In Apache UIMA the TCAS interface has been removed. All uses of it must now be 
replaced by the CAS interface. (All methods that used to be defined on TCAS 
were moved to CAS in v2.0.) The method CAS.getTCAS() is replaced with 
CAS.getCurrentView() and CAS.getTCAS(String) is replaced with 
CAS.getView(String) . The following have also been removed and replaced with 
the equivalent "CAS" variants: TCASException, TCASRuntimeException, TCasPool, 
and CasCreationUtils.createTCas(...).
</p>
<p>
The migration script will apply the necessary replacements.
</p>
  
<h3>2.4. JCas Is Now an Interface</h3>
<p>
In previous versions, user code accessed the JCas class directly. In Apache 
UIMA there is now an interface, org.apache.uima.jcas.JCas, which all JCas-based 
user code must now use. Static methods that were previously on the JCas class 
(and called from JCas cover classes generated by JCasGen) have been moved to 
the new org.apache.uima.jcas.JCasRegistry class. The migration script will 
apply the necessary replacements to your code, including any JCas cover classes 
that are part of your codebase.
</p>
  
<h3>2.5. JAR File names Have Changed</h3>
<p>
The UIMA JAR file names have changed slightly. Underscores have been replaced 
with hyphens to be consistent with Apache naming conventions. For example 
uima_core.jar is now uima-core.jar. Also uima_jcas_builtin_types.jar has been 
renamed to uima-document-annotation.jar. Finally, the jVinci.jar file is now in
the lib directory rather than the lib/vinci directory as was previously the 
case. The migration script will apply the necessary replacements, for example to
script files or Eclipse launch configurations. 
</p>
  
<h3>2.6. Semantic Search Engine Repackaged</h3>
<p>
The versions of the UIMA SDK prior to the move into Apache came with a semantic 
search engine. The Apache version does not include this search engine. The 
search engine has been repackaged and is separately available from 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima">http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima</a>. 
The intent is to hook up (over time) with other open source search engines, 
such as the Lucene search engine project in Apache.
</p>

<h2><a name="migrating">3. Migrating from IBM UIMA to Apache UIMA</a></h2>
<p>
Note: Before running the migration utility, be sure to back up your files, just 
in case you encounter any problems, because the migration tool updates the 
files in place in the directories where it finds them.
</p>
<p>
The migration utility is run by executing the script file 
apache-uima/bin/ibmUimaToApacheUima.bat (Windows) or 
apache-uima/bin/ibmUimaToApacheUima.sh (UNIX). You must pass one argument: the 
directory containing the files that you want to be migrated. Subdirectories 
will be processed recursively.
</p>
<p>
The script scans your files and applies the necessary updates, for example 
replacing the com.ibm package names with the new org.apache package names. 
</p>
<p>
The script will only attempt to modify files with the extensions: java, xml, 
xmi, wsdd, properties, launch, bat, cmd, sh, ksh, or csh; and files with no 
extension. Also, files with size greater than 1,000,000 bytes will be skipped. 
(If you want the script to modify files with other extensions, you can edit 
the script file and change the -ext argument appropriately.)
</p>  
<p>
If the migration tool reports warnings, there may be a few additional steps to 
take. The following two sections explain some simple manual changes that you
might need to make to your code.
</p>
  
<h3>3.1. JCas Cover Classes for DocumentAnnotation</h3>
<p>
If you have run JCasGen it is likely that you have the classes 
com.ibm.uima.jcas.tcas.DocumentAnnotation and 
com.ibm.uima.jcas.tcas.DocumentAnnotation_Type as part of your code. This 
package name is no longer valid, and the migration utility does not move your 
files between directories so it is unable to fix this.
</p>
<p>
If you have not made manual modifications to these classes, the best solution 
is usually to just delete these two classes (and their containing package). 
There is a default version in the uima-document-annotation.jar file that is 
included in Apache UIMA. If you have made custom changes, then you should not 
delete the file but instead move it to the correct package 
org.apache.uima.jcas.tcas. For more information about JCas and 
DocumentAnnotation please see Section 5.5.4, 
"Adding Features to DocumentAnnotation" in the 
  <a href="docs/html/references/index.html">UIMA References</a> manual.
</p>  
  
<h3>3.2. JCas.getDocumentAnnotation</h3>
<p>
The deprecated method JCas.getDocumentAnnotation has been removed. Its use 
must be replaced with JCas.getDocumentAnnotationFs. The method 
JCas.getDocumentAnnotationFs() returns type TOP, so your code must cast this to 
type DocumentAnnotation. The reasons for this are described in Section 
5.5.4, "Adding Features to DocumentAnnotation" in the 
<a href="docs/html/references/index.html">UIMA References</a> manual.
</p>
  
<h3>3.3. Rare Cases Where Additional Manual Migration is Necessary</h3>
<p>
For most users there should not be any additional migration steps necessary.
However, if the migration tool reported an additional warning or if you are 
having trouble getting your code to compile or run after running the migration, 
please see Section 1.4.2. "Rare Cases Where Additional Manual Migration is 
Necessary," in the <a href="docs/html/overview_and_setup/index.html">
Overview and Setup</a> manual.
