    <para>Although UIMA V3 is designed to be backwards compatible with UIMA V2, there are some migration steps
      needed.  These fall into two broad use cases: 
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>if you have an existing UIMA pipeline / application you wish to upgrade to use V3</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>if you are "consuming" the Maven artifacts for the core SDK, as part of another project</para></listitem>

    <title>How to migrate an existing UIMA pipeline to V3</title>
    <titleabbrev>How to migrate</titleabbrev>
    
    <para>
      UIMA V3 is designed to be binary compatible with existing UIMA V2 pipelines, so compiled and/or JAR-ed up classes 
      representing a V2 pipeline should run with UIMA v3, with two changes:
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem><para>Java 8 is required. (If you're already using Java 8, nothing need be done.)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Any defined JCas cover classes must be migrated or regenerated, and used instead.
        (If you do not define any JCas classes or don't use JCas in your pipeline, then nothing need be done.)</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    
    <para>Some Maven projects use the JCasGen maven plugin; these projects' JCasGen maven plugin,
     if switched to UIMA V3, automatically generate the V3 versions.  For proper operation, please run
     maven clean install; the clean operation ought to remove the previously generated JCas class, including the
     UIMA V2 <code>xxx_Type</code> classes, which are not used, won't compile in V3 and need to be deleted. 
    </para>
    
    <para>You can use any of the methods of invoking JCasGen to generate the new V3 versions.  
      If using the Eclipse plugins (i.e., pushing the <code>JCasGen</code>) button in the 
      configuration editor, etc.), the V3 version of the plugin must be the one installed into Eclipse.
    </para>
    
    <para>    
      If you have the source or class files, you can also migrate those using the migration tool described in this section.
      This approach is useful when you've customized the JCas class, and wish to preserve those customizations,
      while converting the v2 style to the v3 style.
    </para>
     
    <!-- 
    <para>For simple testing, after users have migrated or generated any user-supplied JCas classes, 
      users typically will JAR-up these migrated classes,
      and then place that JAR in the class path ahead of the original V2 pipeline's classes so these will replace
      the corresponding classes.

      <title>Modifying a Maven project to support both v2 &amp; v3</title>
      <titleabbrev>Maven v2/v3 simultaneous support</titleabbrev>
      
      <para>When migrating an existing Maven project to v3, you can of course, just change the dependencies, upgrade
      to Java 8 if needed, and migrate/regenerate any user-defined JCas class definitions.  Nothing special is needed
      for this approach.</para>
      
      <para>If you want to simultaneously support both v2 and v3, you can take advantage of the binary compatibility
      support in v3, and have one set of maven artifacts for both (compiled with Java 7), plus an additional
      Maven project just for the generated JCas classes v3-style.  This additional maven project would 
      specify Java 8 and UIMA v3 dependencies, and produce a Jar file with the V3 version, either from migrated Java sources,
      or using the JCasGen maven plugin, generating from the type system description.</para>
      
      <para>
      The using community would see the original output artifacts, plus one new Jar artifact, which, if they were
      wanting to use V3, they would need to place ahead of the original artifacts in the running pipeline's classpath.

    <title>Migrating JCas classes</title>
   
  <!-- repetitious 
  <para>Some projects are built using Maven, and use the JCasGen Maven plugin as part of the build.
  These builds, when switched to depend on version 3, will automatically generate the new JCas
  class definitions, so nothing special need be done.
  </para>
   -->
   
  <para>If you have customized JCasGen classes, these can be migrated by running the migration tool, which is available
	  as a stand-alone command line tool (<code>runV3migrateJCas.sh or ...bat</code>), or 
	  as Eclipse launch configurations.</para>
	  
  <para>This tool is run against a directory tree, and scans all the files in the tree, looking for 
     JCas cover classes.  It can process either source files, or, if those are not available, compiled
     class files (it runs a decompiler on these). 
     It can process these inside directories, as well as inside Jar or PEAR files within those directories.</para>
                
	<para>If you run this tool using a Java 8 JDK (as opposed to a Java JRE),
    the JDK's java compiler will be used to create compiled versions of the migrated classes, 
    and create copies of JARs and/or PEARs with these in them.</para>

  <para>The results of the migration include the migrated class files and a set of logs, summarized in the console
    output, detailing anything that might need inspection to verify the migration was done correctly.
  </para>
  
  <blockquote><para>
    If all is OK, the migration will say that it "finished with no unusual conditions", at the end.
  </para></blockquote> 	  

  <para>To complete the migration, update your UIMA application to use these classes in place of the version 2 JCas classes.
  </para>
    
  <para>The migration tool is able to scan multiple directory trees, looking for existing Java
	  source (.java) or class (.class) files, even inside Jars and PEAR archives. If compiled class files
	  are used as input, a Java decompiler is used to decompile these to source.
	  For PEARs and Jars, it replaces the migrated and compiled classes in copies of the PEARs and Jars.
	</para>
	
	<para>  
	  The actual migration step is a source-to-source transformation, done using a Java parse of the source files.
	  The parts in the source which are version 2 specific with the equivalent version 3 code.
	  Only those parts which need updating are modified;
    other code and comments which are part of the source file are left unchanged.  This is intended to preserve
    any user customization that may have been done.  
    Detailed reports detailing any issues encountered are written to log files. 
  </para>
    
<!--    <section id="uv3.migration.automatic">
    <title>Automatic migration</title>
    
    <para>It is sometimes possible to have this migration done automatically, when a pipeline is started up.  Although
      convenient, it has some drawbacks, the main ones being that it may not work correctly for more complex
      customized JCas sources, and it slows down the launch of pipelines.  Ideally, the migration utility would be used
      and the results checked before proceeding, and the migrated classes replaced in the pipeline(s), as a one time
      migration process.</para>
      
    <para>The automatic migration works by detecting version 2 classes, decompiling them, migrating them, compiling
      the migrated version, and then loading them in place of the version 2 classes.</para>
    
    <para>The automatic migration will throw a Runtime Exception 
    if an unusual condition occurs for any reason during this process.
    </para>
  </section>
 --> 
 		 
		 <note><para>The compilation step (done after the source-to-source transformation) requires that a Java compiler is available 
		   (which will be the case if you're running with a Java JDK, not a JRE).
		 </para></note>
		 
		 <note><para>After running the tool, it is important to examining the console output and logs.
       You can confirm that the migration completed without any unusual conditions, or, if something 
       unusual was encountered, you can take corrective action.

	      there are two versions of this &mdash; one for windows (ending it ".bat") and one for linux / mac (ending in ".sh").
		    If you run this without any arguments, it will show a brief help for the arguments.

        (one for migrating source files, the other for compiled classes and JARs and PEARs),

        (included in the binary distribution of UIMA) in your Eclipse workspace.

      <title>Using Eclipse to run the migration tool</title>
      
        <para>There are two Eclipse launch configurations; one works with source code, the other with compiled classes

          Both launchers write their output to a temporary directory, whose name is printed in the Eclipse console log.
        </para>

    <title>Consuming V3 Maven artifacts</title>
    
    <!-- 
    <para>There are two issues which may affect other projects which consume V3:
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem><para>default logging is now a no-op slf4j logger, and </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>issues using the <code>maven-bundle-plugin.</code></para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
     -->
     
    <para>Projects may have tests which write to the UIMA log.  Because V3 switched to SLF4J as the default logger,
      unless SLF4J can find an adapter to some back-end logger, it will issue a message and substitute a "NO-OP" 
      back-end logger.  If your test cases depend on having the V2 default logger (which was the one built into Java), 
      you need to add a "test" dependency on the SLF4J-to-JDK14 adapter to your POM.  Here's the xml for that:</para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-jdk14</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.24</version>  <!-- or some version you need -->
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>

    <!--     
    <para>If you build OSGi or Eclipse plugins using the <code>maven-bundle-plugin</code>, it will by default
       look to include the slf4j artifacts.  Instead of this, your run-time OSGi environment could frequenly
       already include these artifacts, and you can instruct OSGi to "hook up" to them.
       You can block the attempt to include slf4j directly in your plugin by adding a line to your
       bundle commands such as &lt;import-package&gt; that exclude this package by adding</para>
       <programlisting>!org.slf4j</programlisting>
       <para>to the package list; the "!" says to exclude it.</para>
    <para>Alternatively, you can include it in the bundle by adding a dependency to the version you which to include.</para>
