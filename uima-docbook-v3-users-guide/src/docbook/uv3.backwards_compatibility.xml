  <title>Backwards Compatibility</title>
  <titleabbrev>Backwards Compatibility</titleabbrev>
  
  <para>Because users have made substantial investment in developing
  applications using the UIMA framework, a goal of version 3 is to protect this investment, by enabling
  Annotators and applications developed under previous versions to be able to be used in 
  subsequent versions of the framework.</para>
  
  <para>To this end, version 3 is designed to be backwards compatible, 
  except for needing:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>possibly a recompilation (due to some rearrangements of many classes and interfaces)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>a new set of User-defined JCas classes (if these were
        previously being used). The creation of these Cas classes
        can be done by regenerating them using JCasGen, or by 
        using a migration tool that handles converting the existing JCas classes.
        A later chapter covers how to upgrade the JCas classes.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  There are some additional exceptions, described in the following sections.

    <title>JCas and non-JCas APIs</title>

    <para>The JCas class changes include no longer needing or using the <code>Xyz_Type</code>
      sister classes for each main JCas class.  User code is unlikely to access these sister classes.
      The JCas API method to access this sister class now throws a UnsupportedOperation exception.
    </para>
        
    <para>The non-JCas Java cover classes for the built-in UIMA types remain, for backwards compatibility.
      So, if you have code that casts a Feature Structure instance to AnnotationImpl (a now deprecated 
      version 2 non-JCas Java cover class), that will continue to work.

    <title>APIs for creating and modifying Feature Structures</title>
    
    <para>There are 3 sets of APIs for creating and modifying Feature Structures;
      all are supported in V3.
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>Using the JCas classes</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Using the normal CAS interface with Type and Feature objects</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Using the low level CAS interface with int codes for Types and Features</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    
    <para>Version 3 retains all 3 sets, to enable backward compatibility.</para>
    <para>The low level CAS interface was originally provided to enable a extra-high-performance
      (but without compile-time type safety checks) mode.  
      In Version 3, this mode is actually somewhat slower than the others, and no longer has any advantages.      
    </para>
    <para>Using the low level CAS interface also sometimes blocks one of the new features of Version 3 - 
    namely, automatic
    garbage collection of unreachable Feature Structures.  This is because creating a Feature Structure using the
    low level API creates the Java object for that Feature Structure, but returns an "int" handle to it.  
    In order to be able to find the Feature Structure, given that int handle, an entry is made in an internal map.
    This map holds a reference to this Feature Structure, which prevents it from being garbage collected (until of coursse,
    the CAS is reset).
    </para>
    
    <para>The normal CAS APIs allow writing Annotators where the type system is unknown at compile time; these 
    are fully supported.</para>    
    
  </section>
  
  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.preserve_v2_ids">
    <title>Preserving V2 ids, with low level CAS Api accessibility</title>
    <titleabbrev>Preserving V2 Ids</titleabbrev> 
    
    <para>
      Some V2 applications make use of the Feature Structure address, using these as an integer identifier
      and using the low level CAS APIs to access the Feature Structure, given this integer.  These applications 
       also often use the stability of these ids across some serialization/deserializations.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Normally in V3, deserialization of CASs having these IDs occurs without preserving the IDs, and without setting
      up the low level CAS APIs to be able to access these using them.  If an existing application depends
      on the low level access via the address, a special mode, called <code>V2IdRefs</code>, can be specified, which will support this.
      It comes at a cost however, which is that all new Feature Structures created (or deserialized) will be added to
      an internal table to enable the low level CAS getFSForRef(int) method to work.  As a result, these Feature Structures
      are not eligible for garbage collection. 
    </para>
    
    <para>This mode is set on individual CASs via a new API.  Once set on a CAS, it remains until set to a different value;
      CAS Reset does not affect the setting, nor does checking it into / out of a CAS Pool.  
    </para>
    
    <para>When a new CAS is created, the setting gets a default value, which comes from two sources:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>a <code>-Duima.default_v2_id_references</code> system property, read once when the 
        UIMA framework classes are loaded.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>A setting called <code>defaultV2IdRefs</code>, kept per thread.  The 
          setting is inherited by any child threads the thread creates, and 
          overrides the system property if used.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist> 
    </para>
    
    <para>The APIs for this are part of the LowLevelCAS.  The controlling APIs all return an instance
      of AutoClosable, which can be used to reset the setting to its previous value.
      A recommended way of using these is with the Java <code>try with resources</code> construct: 
    <programlisting>try (AutoClosable w = llcas.ll_enableV2IdRefs) {
  ... some operations
} // automatically restores previous value 
</programlisting>   
    </para>
    
    <para>LowLevelCas instance APIs for enabling/disabling this mode on a particular CAS:</para>
    <programlisting>// set the mode    
AutoClosable ll_enableV2IdRefs()

// same, but with explicit set or reset of the mode
AutoClosable ll_enableV2IdRefs(true/false)

// return true if the mode is enabled
boolean is_ll_enableV2IdRefs() 
</programlisting>

    <para>Static LowLevelCas APIs for setting the default value for this mode for new CASs on a particular thread:</para>
    <programlisting>
// set the default    
AutoClosable LowLeveCas.ll_defaultV2IdRefs()

// same, but with explicit set or reset of the mode
AutoClosable LowLeveCas.ll_defaultV2IdRefs(true/false)

// return true if the mode is enabled
boolean LowLeveCas.is_ll_defaultV2IdRefs() 
</programlisting>   
    
    <para>This mode modifies multiple things in the operation of UIMA V3.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Newly created Feature structures
          have IDs which match what UIMA V2 references (the "addresses")
          would be.  For serialized forms (except Xmi and XCAS), these IDs
          match the (imputed) v2 IDs of the serialized form.
        </para>
        
        <para>Newly created Feature Structures, including those created when deserializing,
          are added to an internal map which maps the ID to the Feature Structure instance.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          In order for this to work correctly, the mode must be set while the CAS is empty.
          If the mode is attempted to be set on a non-empty CAS, an IllegalStateException
          is thrown.  
          <!-- Serialized forms like Xmi and XCAS have the ids 
          included in the external form;
           -->
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>This mode modifies serialization (except for XCAS, Xmi) to include non-reachable FSs.
          If you do not want to include these,  you can surround the serialize call with a try-with-resources 
          that turns the mode off.  But if you do this, there is no guarantee that the IDs will remain the same
          over subsequent serialization/deserialization steps.
        </para>            
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Note: This does not affect the <code>select</code> framework results - unreachable Feature Structures
        are not included.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
         
  </section>
  
  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.PEARs">
    <title>PEAR support</title>   
    
    <para>Pears are supported in Version 3.  If they use JCas, their JCas classes need to be migrated.
    </para>
    
    <para>When a PEAR contains a JCas class definition different from the surrounding non-PEAR context,
    each Feature Structure instance within that PEAR has a lazily-created "dual" representation using
    the PEAR's JCas class definition.  The UIMA framework things storing references to Feature Structures
    are modified to store the non-PEAR version of the Feature Structure, but to return (when in 
    a particular PEAR component in the pipeline) the dual version.  The intent is that this be 
    "invisible" to the PEAR's annotators.  Both of these representations share the same 
    underlying CAS data, so modifications to one are seen in the other.
    </para>
    
    <para>If a user builds code that holds onto Feature Structure references, outside of 
    annotators (e.g., as a shared External Resource), and sets and references these from
    both outside and inside one (or more) PEARs, they should adopt a strategy of storing
    the non-PEAR form.  To get the non-PEAR form from a Feature Structure, use the method
    <code>myFeatureStructure._maybeGetBaseForPearFs()</code>.
    </para>
    
    <blockquote><para>Similarly, if code running in an Annotator within a PEAR wants to
    work with a Feature Structure extracted from non-UIMA managed data outside of annotators
    (e.g., such as a shared External Resource) where the form stored is the non-PEAR form,
    you can convert to the PEAR form using the method 
    <code>myFeatureStructure.__maybeGetPearFs()</code>.  This method checks to see if
    the processing context of the pipeline is currently within a PEAR, and if that PEAR has
    a different definition for that JCas class, and if so, it returns that version of the
    Feature Structure. 
    </para></blockquote>
    
    <para>The new Java Object support does not support multiple, 
      different JCas class definitions for the same 
      UIMA Type, inside and outside of the PEAR context.  
      If this is detected, a runtime exception is thrown.
    </para>
    
    <para>The workaround for this is to manually merge any JCas class definitions for the same class.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.toString">
    <title>toString()</title>   
    
    <para>
      The formatting of various UIMA artifacts, including Feature Structures,
      has changed somewhat, to be more informative.  This may impact 
      situations such as testing, where the exact string representations
      are being compared.
    </para>
    
    <para>A special global Java property, -Duima.v2_pretty_print_format can be set to have the toString() operation
      for Feature Sructures print in the V2 style.
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.logging">
    <title>Logging configuration is somewhat different</title>   
    
    <para>The default logging configuration in v2 was to use Java Util Logging (the logger built into Java).
    For v3, the default is to use SLF4J which, in turn, picks a back-end logger, depending on what it finds
    in the class path.</para>
    
    <para>This change was done to permit easier integration of UIMA as a library running within other frameworks.
    </para>
    
    <para>V3 UIMA logger includes the APIs like info(..), warn(..) etc., that are part of the 
      SLF4j APIs.  In addition, these are augmented with the Java 8 style lambda arguments that
      were introduced in log4j-2, for more concise and efficient log message computation.</para>
      
    <para>The new UIMA Logger APIs (e.g. logger.info(...), logger.warn(...)) 
      use the SLF4j and other modern logger substitutable notation of "{}", as opposed
      to the style adopted by the original Java logger, of "{nnn}".  All modern loggers have switched to
      this. </para>  
      
    <para>The technique for (optionally) reporting the class and method (and sometimes, line number) 
    was changed to conform to current logger conventions - whereby the loggers themselves obtain this
    information from the call stack.  The V2 calls which pass in the sourceClass and sourceMethod information
    have this information ignored, but replaced with what the loggers obtain from the stack track.
    In some cases, where the callers in V2 were not actually passing in the correct class/method information,
    this will result in a different log record.</para>
    
    <para>

    </para>
  </section>
    
  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.typesystem_sharing">
    <title>Type System sharing</title>   
    
    <para>Type System definitions are shared when they are equal.  After type systems 
    have been built up from type definitions, at "commit" time, a check is made to see if an
    identical type system already exists (same types and features).  
    This is often the case when a UIMA application is
    scaling up by adding multiple pipelines, all using the same type system.  
    </para>
    
    <para>If an identical committed type system already exists, then the commit operation returns 
    it, and the one just built is discarded.  Normally, this is not an issue.
    However, some application code may save references to the type system object or to defined types and features.  
    These references end up pointing to the discarded version, when the commit operation finds an already 
    committed equal version.</para>
    
    <para>Application code may code around this by re-acquiring references to the type system object, and to any type and feature
    objects, if the type system instance object returned from <code>commit</code> is not identical (==) to the
    one being committed.
    The type system commit APIs are changed to return the type system - either the one being committed, or an
    already existing equal committed type system.  So when coding
    <code>myTypesystem.commit();</code> if you later refer to <code>myTypesystem</code>, change this to
    <code>myTypesystem = myTypesystem.commit();</code>, to keep the variable <code>myTypesystem</code> always
    referring to to the committed type system.

  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.deserializing_0_length">
    <title>Deserializing 0 length items in a CAS</title>   
    
    <para>In V3, 0-length arrays and lists belonging to one CAS are deserialized into a shared Java object.  Since 
      0-length arrays and lists are
      immutable, this should normally not matter.  It could cause problems if the application somehow is
      depending on object non-identity equality for these items.

  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.checking">
    <title>Some checks moved to native Java</title>   
    
    <para>In the interest of performance, some duplicate checks, such as whether an array index is within bounds, 
    have been removed from UIMA when they are already being checked by the underlying Java runtime.  
    This has affected some of the internal APIs, such as the JCas's <code>checkArrayBounds</code>
    which was removed because it was no longer being used.
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="uv3.backwards_compatibility.class_hierarchy">
    <title>Some class hierarchies have been modified</title>   
    
    <para>The various JCas Classes implementing the built-ins for arrays have some additional
      interfaces added, grouping them into <code>CommonPrimitiveArray</code> or 
      <code>CommonArray</code>.  These changes are internal, and should not affect users.
