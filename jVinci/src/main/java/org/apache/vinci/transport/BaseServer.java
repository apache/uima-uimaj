/**
 * Class for running VinciServables in the Vinci framework. This implementation supports multiple
 * concurrent clients (in a Thread per client manner). Creating a service typically requires
 * defining implementing a VinciServable which is passed to this class to service requests.
 * 
 * This class can be used independently of VNS. For VNS-enhanced serving, use the VinciServer.
 * 
 * This class is designed to be extensible. For example you can extend to provide new Runnable
 * objects that are used to handle requests in the appropriate fashion. You can also override
 * configure socket to install SSL-supporting server sockets, and so on...
