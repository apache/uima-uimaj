# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
#   means that files that GIT determines to be text files, will be 
#     converted from CRLF -> LF upon being added to the repo, and
#     converted from LF -> LF or CRLF when checked out (depending on the platform, I think)
* text=auto

# Make sure that these files are treated as binary so that newlines are preserved.
#   overrides GIT's determination if a file is text or not
*.bin binary
*.dump binary
*.xcas binary
*.xmi binary
#  next is probably the default
*.pdf binary

# These files cannot have crlf, must have just lf
# The "text" by itself says these files must be line-ending-conversion controlled on check-in / out
#   The internal repo form for these is always lf, 
#   The eol=lf means on check-out do nothing, and on check-in, if the file has crlf, convert to lf
*.sh text eol=lf
