 * A component that takes an Object (for text analysis applications, this will often be a String)

 * and populates a CasData with the plain (detagged) text as well as document structure annotations
 * that were inferred from the locations of certain HTML tags (paragraphs and headings, for
 * example).
 * 
 * @deprecated As of v2.0, CAS Initializers are deprecated. A component that performs an operation
 *             like HTML detagging should instead be implemented as a "multi-Sofa" annotator. See
 *             org.apache.uima.examples.XmlDetagger for an example.
