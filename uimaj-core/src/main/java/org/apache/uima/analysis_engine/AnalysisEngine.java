/**
 * An Analysis Engine is a component responsible for analyzing unstructured information, discovering
 * and representing semantic content. Unstructured information includes, but is not restricted to,
 * text documents.
 * <p>
 * An AnalysisEngine operates on an "analysis structure" (implemented by
 * {@link org.apache.uima.cas.CAS}). The <code>CAS</code> contains the artifact to be processed as
 * well as semantic information already inferred from that artifact. The AnalysisEngine analyzes
 * this information and adds new information to the <code>CAS</code>.
 * <p>
 * To create an instance of an Analysis Engine, an application should call
 * {@link org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework#produceAnalysisEngine(ResourceSpecifier)}.
 * <p>
 * A typical application interacts with the Analysis Engine interface as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Call {@link #newCAS()} to create a new Common Analysis System appropriate for this
 * AnalysisEngine.</li>
 * <li>Use the {@link CAS} interface to populate the <code>CAS</code> with the artifact to be
 * analyzed any information known about this document (e.g. the language of a text document).</li>
 * <li>Optionally, create a {@link org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.ResultSpecification} that
 * identifies the results you would like this AnalysisEngine to generate (e.g. people, places, and
 * dates), and call the {#link {@link #setResultSpecification(ResultSpecification)} method.</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #process(CAS)} - the AnalysisEngine will perform its analysis.</li>
 * <li>Retrieve the results from the {@link CAS}.</li>
 * <li>Call {@link CAS#reset()} to clear out the <code>CAS</code> and prepare for processing a new
 * artifact.</li>
 * <li>Repeat steps 2 through 6 for each artifact to be processed.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b> It is highly recommended that you reuse <code>CAS</code> objects rather than
 * calling <code>newCAS()</code> prior to each analysis. This is because <code>CAS</code> objects
 * may be expensive to create and may consume a significant amount of memory.
 * <p>
 * Instead of using the {@link CAS} interface, applications may wish to use the Java-object-based
 * {@link JCas} interface. In that case, the call to <code>newCAS</code> from step 1 above would be
 * replaced by {@link #newJCas()}, and the {@link #process(JCas)} method would be used.
 * <p>
 * Analysis Engine implementations may or may not be capable of simultaneously processing multiple
 * documents in a multithreaded environment. See the documentation associated with the
 * implementation or factory method (e.g.
 * ({@link org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework#produceAnalysisEngine(ResourceSpecifier)}) that you are
 * using.
