JCAS_OLDSTYLE_REF_TO_NONJCAS_TYPE = JCas is referencing via a JFSIterator or get method, a type, "{0}", which has no JCAS class model.  You must use FSIterator instead of JFSIterator.
JCAS_MAKING_ABSTRACT_INSTANCE = A CAS iterator or createFS call is trying to make an instance of type "{0}", but that type has been declared "abstract" in JCas, and no instances are allowed to be made.
JCAS_UNSUPPORTED_OP_NOT_TCAS = The method "{0}" is not supported by this JCAS because it is not associated with a TCAS view of a CAS, but rather just with a base CAS.
SOFANAME_ALREADY_EXISTS = A sofaFS with name {0} has already been created.
SOFADATA_ALREADY_SET = Data for Sofa feature {0} has already been set.
SOFANAME_NOT_FOUND = No sofaFS with name {0} found.
SOFAREF_NOT_FOUND = No sofaFS for specified sofaRef found.
SOFAREF_NOT_SET = Sofa reference for FS {0} is required, but it is not set.  This can happen during deserialization when the type system changes where this FeatureStructure''s type definition is now a subtype of uima.cas.AnnotationBase but was not when the serialized form was created.
PROTECTED_SOFA_FEATURE = Can''t use standard set methods with SofaFS features.
JCAS_MISSING_COVERCLASS = The JCAS cover class "{0}" could not be loaded.
INVALID_FEATURE_PATH = The feature path "{0}" is not valid.
NO_PRIMITIVE_TAIL = The feature path does not end in a primitive valued feature.
BLOB_SERIALIZATION = Error trying to do binary serialization of CAS data and write the BLOB to an output stream.
BLOB_DESERIALIZATION = Error while deserializing binary CAS. {0}.
LENIENT_FORM_6_NO_TS = Deserializing Compressed Form 6 with CasLoadMode LENIENT, but no Type System provided.
UNRECOGNIZED_SERIALIZED_CAS_FORMAT = Unrecognized serialized CAS format.
SOFADATASTREAM_ERROR = Error trying to open a stream to Sofa data.
INVALID_BASE_CAS_METHOD = Can''t call method "{0}" on the base CAS.
ANNOTATION_IN_WRONG_INDEX = Error - the Annotation "{0}" is over view "{1}" and cannot be added to indexes associated with the different view "{2}".
TYPE_NOT_IN_INDEX = Error accessing index "{0}" for type "{1}".  Index "{0}" is over type "{2}", which is not a supertype of "{1}".
DISALLOW_CREATE_ANNOTATION_IN_BASE_CAS = The type "{0}", a subtype of AnnotationBase, can''t be created in the Base CAS.
CANNOT_CLONE_SOFA = SofaFS may not be cloned.
DELTA_CAS_PREEXISTING_FS_DISALLOWED = "Preexisting FS encountered but not allowed. "{0}"
INVALID_MARKER = Marker is invalid.
MULTIPLE_CREATE_MARKER = CreateMarker called multiple times for one CAS.  This implementation only supports one call.
DESERIALIZING_BINARY_INVALID_HEADER = While deserializing binary CAS, found invalid header.
DESERIALIZING_COMPRESSED_BINARY_UNSUPPORTED = Using the reinit method to deserialize a binary CAS serialized with compressed serialization not supported for this case.
DEREF_FS_OTHER_CAS = Dereferencing a FeatureStructure of a CAS in a different CAS''s context. This can happen if you try to set a feature structure reference to a value of a feature structure belonging to an entirely different CAS. FS = "{0}", CAS = "{1}".
ILLEGAL_FEAT_SET = While a FeatureStructure was in the index, an illegal attempt was made to modify Feature "{0}" which is used as a key in one or more indices; the Feature Structure being modified was "{1}".
LENIENT_NOT_SUPPORTED = Lenient deserialization not support for input of type {0}.
SWITCH_CLASS_LOADER_NESTED = Multiply nested classloaders not supported.  Original base loader: {0}, current nested loader: {1}, trying to switch to loader: {2}.
