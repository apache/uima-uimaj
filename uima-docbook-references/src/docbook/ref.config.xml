  <titleabbrev>Setup and Configuration</titleabbrev>

  <section id="ugr.ref.config.properties">
    <title>UIMA JVM Configuration Properties</title>
    
    <para> Some updates change UIMA's behavior between released versions.  For example, sometimes an error check
  is enhanced, and this can cause something that previously incorrect but not checked, to now signal an error.
  Often, users will want these kinds of things to be ignored, at least for a while, to give them time to 
  analyze and correct the issues.
    </para> 
    
    <para>
      To enable users to gradually address these issues, there are some global JVM properties
  for UIMA that can restore earlier behaviors, in some cases.  
  These are detailed in the table below.  Additionally, there are other JVM properties that can
  be used in checking and optimizing some performance trade-offs, such as the automatic index protection.
  For the most part, you don't need to assign any values to these properties,
  just define them.  For example to disable the enhanced check that insures you 
  don't add a subtype of AnnotationBase to the wrong View, you could disable this by
  adding the JVM argument <code>-Duima.disable_enhanced_check_wrong_add_to_index</code>.  
  This would remove the enhanced
  checking for this, added in version 2.7.0 (the previously existing partial checking is
  still there, though).  
    </para>
  </section>   
 
  <section id="ugr.ref.config.protect-index">
    <title>Configuring index protection</title>
    
    <para>A new feature in version 2.7.0 optionally can include checking for invalid feature updates 
    which could corrupt indexes.  Because this checking can slightly slow down performance, there are 
    global JVM properties to control it.  The suggested way to operation with these is as follows.
    <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para>At the beginning, run with automatic protection enabled (the default), but
	    turn on explicit reporting (<code>-Duima.report_fs_update_corrupts_index</code>)</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>For all reported instances, examine your code to see if you can restructure to
	    do the updates before adding the FS to the indexes.  Where you cannot, surround the code doing 
	    these updates with a try / finally or block form of <code>protectIndexes()</code>, 
	    which is described in  
	     <xref linkend="ugr.ref.cas.updating_indexed_feature_structures"/> (and also is similarly available with JCas). 
	    </para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>After no further reports, for maximum performance, leave in the protections 
	    you may have installed in the above step, and then disable the reporting and runtime checking, 
	    using the JVM argument  
	    <code>-Duima.disable_auto_protect_indexes</code>, and removing (if present) 
	    <code>-Duima.report_fs_update_corrupts_index</code>.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    One additional JVM property, <code>-Duima.throw_exception_when_fs_update_corrupts_index</code>, 
    is intended to be used in automated build / testing configurations.  It causes the framework to throw
    a UIMARuntimeException if an update outside of a <code>protectIndexes</code> block occurs 
    that could corrupt the indexes,
    rather than "recovering" this.  
    </para>

                        As of version 2.7.0, adding a particular Feature Structure

                        Updating Features which are used in Set and Sorted
                        indexes as "keys" may corrupt the indexes, if the Feature Structure (FS)
                        has been added to the indexes.  To update these, you must first
                        completely remove the FS from the indexes in all views, then do the updates, and then
                        add it back.  UIMA now checks for this (unless specifically disabled, see below),
                        and if this property is set, will log WARN messages for each occurrence unless
                        the user does explicit <code>protectIndexes</code> (see CAS JavaDocs for CAS / JCas <code>protectIndexes</code> methods), if this
                        property is defined.</para>
